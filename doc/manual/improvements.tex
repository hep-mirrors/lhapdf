These are the improvements.

C++

Pure grid interpolation library, extremely extensible is anyone is
crazy enough to want to do anything more... (PDF Evolving would be
possible as long as it obeys PDF interface, let's not mention it
otherwise someone will eventually want it.)

PDG ID code usage to identifiy flavors, instead of LHAPDFv5
definitions of f(-6:6).

Swappable interpolators, no longer hard coded interpolators for each
PDFSet

Extensible Metadata through YAML, don't know what to say, other than it
is not as inflexible as LHAPDFv5, currently it is a subset of YAML,
frankly because YAML-C++ sucks! (They took c++ and abused it)

\alphaS evolution? \todo{Steve please continue here\dots}
