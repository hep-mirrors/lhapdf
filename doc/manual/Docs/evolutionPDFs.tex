Evolution PDFs differ from Interpolation PDFs as they do not internally
store a grid array, and so use a lot less RAM. However (in my estimation),
they still need to do the calculation to generate the relevant part of the
grid when you try to call getXFX. This is not stored, so there is no need
to go through the trouble of allocating a large array and doing a lot of
pointing. Hence the distinction between evolution and interpolation PDFs.
(One further distinction is that the order of the header file is different
for evolution and interpolation PDFs)

The data stored in LHpdf files are the parameters used by their fit
functions. These fit functions have been reimplemented in LHAPDF6, and the
values produced by them are the same. They are stored within
Tools/PDF\_Info.H

The MakeActive function of evolutionPDFs is quite small and only serves the
purpose to call the wrappers pdf function, which initialises the member.
