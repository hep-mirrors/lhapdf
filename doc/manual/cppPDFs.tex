The C++ PDF is the future of LHAPDF PDFs, and will increase the speed, and
decrease the memory usage, further. Currently there are complications in
the way of C++ PDFs, more than simply implementing the PDF itself.
LHAPDF's header read routines are tied to the Fortran implementation and so
they will need to be either abstracted into the PDF\_Base class (with
difficulty) OR they will neeed to be reimplemented.

However, in principal something descending from the (currently 
unimplemented) CPP\_PDF\_Base would need to provide only four functions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The constructor
  \item The xfx evolution routine
  \item The $\alpha_S$ evolution routine
  \item The destructor
\end{itemize}

It would not be possible (and probably would be undesirable) to use the
dynamic linking mechanisms of the Fortran PDFs as dlopen is unable to deal
with dynamically linking classes.
