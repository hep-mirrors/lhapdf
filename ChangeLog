2013-06-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Mapping addition of PDFSet, more factory functions, and related changes into Python.

2013-06-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding default values to PDF::xMin/Max and PDF::q2Min/Max.

2013-06-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Bump version number for 6.0.0 beta2 (hopefully to be released soon).

	* Adding an availablePDFSets() function.

2013-06-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an LHAPDF_VERSION_CODE macro for version detection.

	* Moving contents of Config.h -> Version.h (leaving Config.h name free for potential Info subclass).

	* Adding PDFSet::mkPDF(int).

	* Renaming return-type specialisations of Info::metadata() to
	metadata_to(), to avoid nasty template/untemplated method
	resolution errors once inheritance got involved.

	* Removing various deprecated path constructors and general
	related API rehashing.

	* Adding Info::metadata_local(key)

	* Renaming config() to getConfig() and moving to Factories, to
	match getPDFSet(name).

	* Using a new info cascading system including PDFSet.

	* Adding singleton system for PDFSet, and a dedicated PDFInfo type
	for member info.

2013-06-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Rename ImplicitFlavorAction config flag to UndefFlavorAction

	* More build system tweaks, including removal of yaml-cpp flags
	from build of example programs that link against libLHAPDF.

	* Moving broken -I/-L and -D flag settings from configure.ac to
	selected Makefile.am's

	* Adding PDFSet, and migrating examples/testpdfset.cc to use it.

2013-05-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Treat a request for PID = 0 as if PID 21 (gluon) had been
	requested. Useful for backward compatibility, but also just for
	convenience since it's much easier to just loop from -6 to 6 than
	to have to skip 0 and add 21 as a special case.

2013-05-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding x/Q2/Q min/max (virtual) functions to the PDF
	interface. Default implementations use metadata keys only.

	* Adding in-place filling functions for map and vector PDF value
	containers, on the PDF interface.

2013-05-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* configure.ac, src/Info.cc: Re-adding yaml-cpp 0.3.x support via
	version detection in the configure script.

2013-05-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* src/Info.cc: Converting the YAML reading to use the yaml-cpp v0.5.x API.

	* Tweaking and fixing tests and build config.

2013-04-17  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a PDF set usage example (uses C++11 for now, for fun!)

2013-04-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Rename of wrapper dir from cython -> python (reflect the target,
	not the way of achieving it).

	* Python extension build env fix

2013-04-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Improving creategrids to use xmin and qmin/max when dumping
	LHpdf files and to allow a manual override for LHgrid
	dumps. CTEQ6L1 looking *almost* publicly acceptable now.

	* examples/: Resurrecting old testpdf.cc as an example (used by Doxygen)

	* migration/: Using compatibility stuff to improve dumpv5v6.cc

	* Adding LHAPDF_MAJOR_VERSION macro and examples/compatibility.cc

	* AUTHORS list tweak since James added substantial code for Fortran compatibility.

	* Adding copyright etc. notices to each file header.

	* Adding LHAPDF.h convenience header.

2013-04-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fix ctypes handling in creategrids

	* Adding ignoring (and writing) of a 3rd grid block line, to
	specify "internal flavor" ID codes. Not actually parsed or
	used... yet.

	* Cleaning up LHAGlue compilation warnings

	* Config flag updates and clarifications, and adding API
	mechanisms for numMembers and LHAPDF ID lookup.

2013-04-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Further improved creategrid, comparison, and plotting
	scripts. Better high-xipol knots -> much better agreement. Nearly
	done.

2013-04-08  James Ferrando  <james.ferrando@cern.ch>

	* Fortran PDFLIB function mapping works now: good agreement with
	LHA5 via PYTHIA6.

2013-04-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* migration/plotv5v6 improvements with line styles and labels.

	* Improved/fixed migration/creategrid which excludes grid points
	at x=0 (which screwed up handing over to extrapolation) and fixes
	numpy array manipulation. Low-x behaviour is now good, high-x
	needs some inspection: getting close to acceptable at last!

	* Fixes to dumpv5v6.cc flavour ID and output filenames.

2013-04-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Re-enabling the -Wno-long-long flag if possible, to avoid build
	warnings stemming from yaml-cpp.

2013-04-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* migration/: Many updates to comparison scripts, and adding a
	plotv5v6 script and new README instructions.

	* migration/: Combined dumpv5.cc and dumpv6.cc into a single
	dumpv5v6.cc, with the version selected by a preprocessor macro.

2013-04-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Build system fixes... *finally* working on lxplus! :-)

2013-03-25  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Re-wrangling dump, comparison, and migration scripts.

	* Fixing accidental shift of LHAGlue default member from 0 ->
	1. The default index = 1 should only apply to the multiset index
	used by non-multiset functions.

2013-03-24  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing uses of Boost range algorithms -- nice, but apparently
	introduces a bit too much sensitivity on Boost version for some
	Mac and SL systems.

	* Adding a NotImplementedError!

	* Adding main PDFLIB functions as implemented in PYTHIA6's pdfdummies.f.

2013-03-23  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding non-multiset versions of LHAGlue.cc functions.

	* Use 1 rather than 0 as the lowest (and default) multi-set index
	in LHAGlue.cc.

2013-03-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Using much cleverer Boost discovery macros (with a slight fix)
	from https://github.com/tsuna/boost.m4. Need to feed back the
	fix...

	* Adding --with-boost-lib, --with-boost-inc, and
	--with-yaml-cpp-lib, --with-yaml-cpp-inc configure flags,
	particularly for use on systems where Boost's install is a bit
	borked and there is no common prefix dir for which $prefix/lib and
	$prefix/include are valid dirs.

2013-03-05  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Convert LHAGlue.cc to load the 0th member on set initialisation,
	plus some other tweaks (this matches the v5 behaviour _and_ makes
	it much harder to get into an inconsistent state).

2013-03-03  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Remove -ansi from the compiler setup (the long long in some
	yaml-cpp versions is causing trouble, at least on Macs with gcc
	4.2)

2013-03-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an example script for using the Python wrapper, and
	improving/fixing the mkPDF mapping.

2013-03-01  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Some LHAGlue fixes and improvements.

	* Fixing environment variable updating for path handling.

	* Adding Cython docstrings and path/version functions.

	* Integrating the Cython extension build into the autotools build/install.

	* Path handling and PDF data file search error reporting fixes/improvements.

	* Add a fallback to use LHAPATH if LHAPDF_DATA_PATH is undefined. (pre-deprecated?)

	* Re-enabling Cython mapping (only the basic functionality subset).

	* Adding LHAPDF::version() function.

	* Adding configure testing for -mt versions of Boost (file)system libs.

2013-02-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding name+member and LHAPDF ID constructors for Info.

	* Moving config() out of Info.

2013-02-27  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Implemented PDF::setname() and PDF::memberid().

2013-02-26  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a lhapdf-config build assistant script.

	* Adding hacky first implementations of log-space interpolators. Separation of x and Q2 ipol seems ever more likely.

	* Started work on new LaTeX manual/paper, based on previous contribution from Ben and Marek.

	* Cleaning up defunct wrappers directories.

	* Fixing a bug in handling of nearest knot lookup for underflow x/Q2 requests.

2013-02-15  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding installation and usage instructions to the Doxy manual.

2013-02-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fixing install path data lookup to include the 'LHAPDF' part.

	* Fixed use of interpolation up to the last knot (in Q2, at least)
	by making KnotArray1F::x/q2below never return the last index.

2013-02-12  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Now installing pdfsets.index into the share dir.

	* Now installing lhapdf.conf into the share dir.

	* Header dependence reduction and include statement clean-up.

	* Reworking Interpolator and GridPDF interfaces to centralise
	index finding. KnotArray1F and NF are now defined as non-inner
	classes in a separate KnotArray.h header.

2013-02-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding a new implementation of NearestPointExtrapolator.

2013-02-04  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding migration/testpdf.cc and corresponding README instructions.

	* Removed debug printout from GridPDF.cc and re-added xKnots() and q2Knots() methods.

	* Updated creategrids script to new format.

	* Creating the migration directory.

2013-01-29  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Updates to TODOs, CONFIGFLAGS, DESIGN, etc. after first dev meeting.

	* More Doxygen: making the namespace and free functions documented, with grouping.

2013-01-28  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding backward compatibility special case treatment for the "cteq6ll" misspelling from prehistory.

	* Adding setting of available AlphaS params in the PDF interface.

	* Adding search path set/append/prepend functions, using the LHAPDF_DATA_PATH env variable.

	* More methods, and public access to most data members on AlphaS.

2013-01-25  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding sorting of the flavor array when reading from metadata
	(and use of Boost range sort)

	* Fixed clearing of temp double* array variable so subgrid loading
	now works. Interpolation across subgrid boundaries not tested!

	* Added two more ways to assign the grid data arrays, but the
	original way seems fine. Now defining the grid data x/Q2 loop
	order.

	* Fixed the AnalyticPDF example: now simpler _and_ it works :)

	* A bit of virtual function rethinking on PDF.

2013-01-23  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding code to allow comments in the grid data blocks.

	* Some DESIGN doc cleanup.

	* Moving tests and their output data files into the tests/ dir.

	* Build system tweaks: adding --with args to configure for Boost and yaml-cpp, and a 'doxy' target.

2013-01-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Removing defunct data and knot members from GridPDF.

	* Including general doc files in Doxygen output and finessing Doxygen comments.

	* Adding Doxyfile.in with basic Doxy config.

	* Adding initial CONFIGFLAGS and CODINGSTYLE doc files.

	* AlphaS_ODE reworking -- lots needed.

2013-01-21  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding an empty AlphaS_Ipol and making AlphaS_Analytic work with a smooth Lambda4/5 transition.

	* First PDF interpolation test added to testgrid.cc. Looks like it works!

	* Refactoring of the bicubic interpolator.

	* Fixed multi_array reshaping in PDFGrid loading.

	* Removing PDFSet files.

	* Disabling PWD searching due to infinite loop in calls to paths().

2013-01-20  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* More alpha_s calculator evolution, mainly file splitting and adding more data members.

2013-01-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Making inter/extrapolator loading lazy (and neater as a consequence!)

	* Renaming PDFGrid -> GridPDF.

2013-01-13  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Using std::auto_ptr to handle Interpolator/Extrapolator
	assignment to PDFGrid, and cleaning up the interface and
	implementation a bit.

	* Using boost::shared_ptr to implement the memory handling in
	LHAGLUE. NB. not std::auto_ptr, or boost::scoped_ptr, and although
	std::unique_ptr would be ideal it requires C++11.

	* Adding alpha_s(Q2) calculation mechanism to the PDF
	interface. AlphaS calculation is not yet properly implemented and
	tested, though, cf. grid interpolation!

	* Adding src/Factories.cc to hide the implementation details /
	dependencies for factory users.

	* Added Info::metadata<bool> template specialisation to handle
	true/false/on/off/yes/no as well as 0/1 strings.

	* Add src/Paths.cc to avoid circular header dependencies.

	* Add LHAPDF_{INSTALL,DATA}_PREFIX variables and PwdInSearchPath
	config flag, and use them in search path determination.

2013-01-11  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Start of the AlphaS refactoring.

	* Metadata methods and flavour list caching added to PDF.

	* Renaming PDFInfo.h/.cc to just Info.h/.cc

	* Renaming LHAPDFConfig.h -> Config.h

	* DESIGN doc updates.

	* Factory renaming and adding factory functions for PDF construction.

	* PDF and PDFInfo extra constructors from LHAPDF ID code.

	* Moving PDFInfo YAML reading into a new PDFInfo.cc to avoid an API header dependency.

	* Refactoring PDF filename construction etc. to minimise code duplication.

	* Adding the PDFIndex.h header and index lookup functions.

	* Adding the start of the LHA Fortran wrapper, based on the Py8
	wrapper by Steve and Martin.

2013-01-10  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* More PDFGrid data loading development: improvements to the API
	and the data parser now works.

	* Adding the error extrapolator to the extrapolator factory function.

2013-01-09  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* A few tweaks to the info/data loader system: PDF loading from
	set name + member ID with cascading info/set/config levels WORKS!

	* Adding more constructors for PDFGrid, calling the new ones on
	PDF to populate the Info class.

	* Adding the EXAMPLEPDF directory for testing.

2013-01-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding example lhapdf.conf.

	* Inlining, clean-up and other tweaks.

	* Adding PDF base constructors with loading apparatus for info
	from member files + discovery and loading of set-level info.

2013-01-07  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding to_str variants for both single objects and for vectors
	of objects which are convertible to string via lexical_cast.

	* Adding the YAML parser operation to the Info class (and its subclasses).

	* Removing Types.h in favour of split Utils.h and Exceptions.h

	* include/LHAPDF/Paths.h: Adding path searching machinery (using Boost.Filesystem).

2013-01-02  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Adding some of the necessary infrastructure for subgrids, and
	rewriting the grid format parser to handle separated subgrid
	blocks. Boost.MultiArray being used for the internal storage in
	place of the dynamically allocated C arrays. Metadata methods are
	currently disabled for porting to the cascading Info system.

2013-01-01  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Major restructuring of the API: lots of subtle problems with the
	first attempt, and room for improvement. Painful, but worth the
	reworking to get it right. Lots left to do... see the TODO and
	DESIGN files for the ideas and tasks.

2012-10-22  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Start of autotools build system on top of initial summer student
	work by Martin and Steve.
