Instructions for building and running migration scripts/programs
----------------------------------------------------------------

To migrate a PDF, install LHAPDF5 (including the Python module) and call e.g.

./creategrids CT10.LHgrid

This will create the .info set metadata file and .lha grid data files in a (new) CT10 directory.

To test the new PDFs, a member at a time, build the testpdf program, e.g.:

g++ testpdf.cc -I$HOME/heplocal/include -L$HOME/heplocal/lib -lLHAPDF -lboost_filesystem -lboost_system -o testpdf

and run it with set and member ID as arguments, making sure to specify the paths to the lhapdf.conf and current dir:

LHAPDF_DATA_PATH=$PWD:$PWD/.. ./testpdf CT10 0

(TODO: why isn't lhapdf.conf being found automatically?)
