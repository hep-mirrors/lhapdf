LHAPDF6 TODO list
-----------------

* Design sub-grid "patch" system

* Implement numerica alpha_s running with several options, and also support
   interpolation of tablulated alpha_s values (with 1D subgrids).

* Only expose headers with the public interface: internalise headers used for
   implementation components only.
