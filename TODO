LHAPDF6 TODO list
=================

VERSION 6.0.2
-------------

- **Build system issues**

   Libs not found during tests builds? (Only build tests with "make check?")
   BOOST_DIR variable doesn't work / Boost not found on Mac+Fink?

- **alpha_s validation**

   Check low-Q log gradient extrapolation.


VALIDATION / MIGRATION
----------------------

- **Put validation plot PDFs on Web**

- **NNPDF2.3 PDF validation (AB)**

   Looks good except at HF Q thresholds. Need to validate the top PDFs.

- **MSTW2008 PDF validation (AB)**

   Mostly done: subgrid migration and interpolation is working.
   => Approved for now, but still some deviations. ForcePosDef *and* more
   sophisticated low Q2 treatment needed?

- **Final CT10 / CT10nlo migrations**

   Need ForcePosDef option to get exact behaviours without overshoots (also for
   CTEQ6L1?). Add a --posdef flag to creategrids to make this easier
   (e.g. should be used for all CTEQ sets and for NNPDF MC sets)



WRITE PAPER
-----------

- ** Target at EPJC Tools or CPC?**

   Can put on arXiv before October, but delay publication submission to aim
   (hope) for for eligibility in *next* UK REF.

- **Note fixed problems**

   NNPDF misreported xmin. Support for different set sizes. alpha_s etc. in
   multi-set mode. Lambda reporting to PYTHIA. **ADD MORE AS WE REMEMBER THEM**



VERSION 6.1
-----------

- **Print out a banner?**

   Obnoxious or useful? In response to PDF author requests? Must be disableable
   via Verbosity=0!

- **Gradient extrapolator for PDF x/Q**

   Keep extrapolating linearly outside the range (in log space).

- **Add a ForcePosDef config option**

   If enabled, return 0 in place of any negative PDF value. Cache config flag
   value to avoid repeated slow metadata lookups. Should solve problems with
   extreme low-Q threshold behaviours in CT10(nlo) PDFs.

- **Add Info/Config mappings to Cython (AB)**

  And alphasQ(q) etc. to PDF, plus 2-arg versions of xfxQ(x, q) etc.

- **Add AlphaS mappings to Cython (AB)**

- **Add mkPDFs<SMART_PTR> templated vector-filling functions (AB)**


VERSION 6.x
-----------

- **PDF flavor aliasing mechanism**

   e.g. allow anti-flavours to be identical without duplicating their grids in
   the data files or memory.

- **Optimize the grid PDF interpolator code a bit more**

   Cache log(x), log(Q) between samplings -> log() still accounts for 15% of
   CPU: can reduce by factor of 13, typically (only one call for a whole flavour
   interpolation set at the same point).

- **Expose LHAGLUE slots system for C++ use**

   Automatic memory management can be nice for everyone.

- **MRST2004qed migration?**

   Definitely needs special treatment. Even possible?

- **Improved x -> 1 (and Q -> 0?) evolution (GW,...)**

   Graeme, etc.: x -> 1 extrapolation should be done carefully to ensure that
   all PDFs -> 0 at x = 1.0, (usually) without going negative. This probably
   deserves specialisation beyond generic splines. Graeme will look at what's
   done in the CTEQ code (other than interpolating in x**0.3)
   Graeme also recommends a specialist interpolation treatment at low Q.

- **Read zipped/tarred PDFs**

   With standard directory structure internally. Maybe
   https://code.google.com/p/fuse-zip/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf/?
   Most VFSes seem more designed for CLI use than programmatic ZIP access.

- **Add helper functions for calculating PDF errors on observables**

   Certainly a good thing to provide an example for... maybe it should just be
   provided as an example? One nice thing is that since we now store a clear
   ErrorType metadata entry for each PDF set, working out the appropriate error
   treatment should be easy (I think it's best to not use words like
   "infallible"!)


AS AND WHEN
-----------

- **Allow use of valence/sea etc. decompositions**

   GridPDF may be inherited from to allow the returned values to be built from
   separate interpolations of component PDFs such as interpolated valence, sea,
   or difference PDFs that are combined to make the physical ones. The PDG ID
   code range for "generator specific" applications may be used, but we'll need
   to bear in mind that this will mean that the flavor ID list has different
   meanings and contents for internal and external purposes: maybe the
   "internal" PDG ID list needs to become part of the grid data header, or can
   the metadata be used?

- **More aggressive memory and CPU optimisation**

   For example avoiding duplication of x,Q knot arrays between flavors... if
   this "1D" effect is really significant.

- **Support photon structure functions**

   Need to make use of the P2 and IP2 params. No idea how to even start here...

- **Support nuclear corrections**

   Have to be applyable to all nucleon PDFs, regardless of implementation:
   probably nuclear PDFs will inherit from PDF (since they are PDFs) and
   _contain_ a nucleon PDF whose values will be modified before returning.

- **Using std::/boost::function to generically modify the interpolation measures in x, Q (AB)**

- **Use Autoconf's more robust FC_* Fortran function name macros?**

   This would require testing for a Fortran compiler, which we would rather not
   do... Test for a Fortran compiler unless told not to build LHAGLUE? **These
   things arguably cause as many problems as they solve!**

- **Separate the x and Q2 inter/extrapolation?**

   Allow mix & match combinations. Would this simplify the code since the
   1D interpolation methods are very simple and the 2D is built from them?

- **Make GridPDFs not read their info or data blocks until an xf value is requested?!**

   Super-laziness!

- **Speed up interpolation with (opportunistic) GPU and/or threaded interpolation**

   Interpolation of PDFs seems like an ideal use case for PDFs, since it's
   normal to query for all partons in the set at once: if we can load the
   relevant ipol anchors for all flavours onto the GPU then we can maybe get a
   substantial speedup (with Amdahl's Law as the obvious caveat). Good student
   project...

- **Use HDF5 for the data access?**

   David has more info: I've only ever looked at it in a very rudimentary way,
   e.g. playing with PyTables. Sounds good in principle: I prefer a *real world*
   standard to ROOT, anyway ;-) Does it have any string/typed annotation
   mechanism that we could use?

- **Updated Octave wrapper**
