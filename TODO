LHAPDF6 TODO list
-----------------

* Design & implement sub-grid "patch" system
   Implement in 1D first, then integrate into (x,Q) interpolation. Subgrids
   should only be necessary in Q... and also needed for alpha_s ipol.

* Implement numerical alpha_s running with several options, and also support
   interpolation of tablulated alpha_s values (with 1D subgrids).

* Only expose headers with the public interface
   Internalise headers used for implementation components only.

* LHAGLUE interface, including number -> set name mappings

* Treating missing flavours with error vs. return 0
   Provide a switch to distinguish the two responses. Put ID check into
   PDF::xfxQ2 function?

* Interpolation in (log(x), log(Q2)) as well as (x, Q)

* Validation system and plotting
   Don't try to link both LHAPDFs simultaneously. Generate a big x,Q sample
   point list, then separately dump out xf(x) values into separate files with
   old and new LHAPDF, and finally compare the files line-by-line, with
   pulls/ratios to the "old" LHAPDF as the reference.

* Deal specially with CTEQ6L1
   The old LHAPDF set was misnamed as CTEQ6ll (two L's). Need some backward
   compatibility at the same time as sorting out the misnaming.

* More Fortran API elements? On demand after first beta release

* Set search paths (default and LHAPDF_SET_PATH) and version string access
