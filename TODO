LHAPDF6 TODO list
-----------------

NOW

* Adapt interpolators and extrapolators to use new grid format.
   Plus a slight rename to e.g. GridInterpolator?

* Interpolator/Extrapolator attachment to PDFGrid in both directions
   Means that e.g. Extrapolator can make use of the current interpolator.

* Caching of grid indices in Interpolator and Extrapolator interfaces

* Fix and test numerical and analytic alpha_s running
   Define params on AlphaS and subclasses, and set them in the PDF interface
   creation method.


NEXT

* Add Boost and yaml-cpp detection and path-passing to build system
   Can yaml-cpp be kept completely internal and bundled?

* Enable Doxygen building
   And put the DESIGN and CONFIGFLAGS documents into the Doxy output

* Strip file extensions and deal specially with CTEQ6L1 in LHAGLUE
   The old LHAPDF set was misnamed as CTEQ6ll (two L's). Need some backward
   compatibility at the same time as sorting out the misnaming. Only in the
   Fortran interface?

* Treating missing flavours with error vs. return 0
   Provide a switch to distinguish the two responses. Put ID check into
   PDF::xfxQ2 function?

* Find a way to specify whether PWD is to be searched, if possible
   The Config mechanism can't be used as it uses the path searching in its
   initialisation: an infinite loop results.

* Really old PDFLIB-style xfx etc. functions, and the non-*m LHAPDF5 Fortran subroutines.
   Both should just use nset = 0 all the time.

* Forbid PDF construction from a direct path to the data file?
   Rely on dir structure instead? Do PDFs _need_ to have a dir? (Maybe yes)
   Same set of constructors for PDF (and derivatives) and Info?

* Add more metadata methods to PDF and PDFGrid as needed


FOR BETA 1

* lhapdf-config build assistant script

* Validation system and plotting
   Don't try to link both LHAPDFs simultaneously. Generate a big x,Q sample
   point list, then separately dump out xf(x) values into separate files with
   old and new LHAPDF, and finally compare the files line-by-line, with
   pulls/ratios to the "old" LHAPDF as the reference.

* Printing out banner info... needed by code that greps for it :-/
   e.g. ATLAS' Generate_trf.py ...

* Throw/assert if dir name and file name are inconsistent


FOR BETA 2

* Interpolation in (log(x), log(Q2)) as well as (x, Q)

* Add interpolation-from-metadata implementation of AlphaS

* More Fortran API elements
   On demand after first beta release.

* Updated lhapdf-getdata, downloading PDFs as tarballs


FOR STABLE 6.0.0 RELEASE

* Versioning scheme for PDF data
   In metadata and tarball filenames.

* Python interface
   For access to standard functionality but not pluggable in the sense that a
   Python interpolator class cannot be passed to a wrapped PDF object: so hide
   the non-factory-based functions.


AS AND WHEN

* Read zipped/tarred PDFs
   With standard directory structure internally.

* Updated Octave wrapper
