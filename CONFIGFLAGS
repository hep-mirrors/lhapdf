LHAPDF v6 CONFIGURATION FLAGS
=============================

Documentation of the configuration flags for use in LHAPDF at the global
settings, PDF set info, and PDF member info levels. If a configuration key
is requested from a PDF member info and is not found, the search will fall
back to first the PDF set and then to the global config.


CONFIG LEVEL
============

Verbosity
---------
(uint)

Level of verbosity of the LHAPDF system.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!


ShowBanner
----------
(bool)

Whether or not to print out an LHAPDF5-style banner to stdout upon PDF
initialisation.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED


UndefFlavorAction
-----------------
(enum string): return_zero, error

What to do if an xf value for an unsupported PID code is requested? Either
return 0 (i.e. there is implicitly none of that parton in the hadron) or throw
an error.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: TOO MUCH OVERHEAD? (A METADATA STRING WOULD BE CHECKED FOR EVERY ACCESS TO 6/-6 UNLESS CACHING IS USED)


PwdInSearchPath
---------------
(bool)

Whether to implicitly include the current directory in the PDF set search path.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!



SET LEVEL
=========

SetDesc
-------
MANDATORY
(free string): A human-readable description of this PDF set.


Authors
-------
MANDATORY
(free string): Authors of this PDF set.


Year
----
OPTIONAL
(uint): Year in which this PDF fit was made.


Reference
---------
OPTIONAL
(free string): A reference to the paper that describes this PDF set. Use semicolons
to separate a standard journal string, arXiv ID, DOI code, etc.


Flavors
-------
MANDATORY
(list<int> or int): [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,21]

List of supported (user-visible) parton flavors, using the PDG Monte Carlo
numbering scheme (quarks from 1 .. 6, antiquarks from -6 .. -1, and gluon = 21,
as well as any "optional extras" such as photon = 22).


NumMembers
----------
MANDATORY
(uint): 1

How many members there are in the set, including the central member(s) and error
set members.

Note: there is no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are
consecutively numbered. This number is the official number of members in the
released set.


NumErrorMembers
---------------
OPTIONAL... may _become_ mandatory?
(uint): e.g. 50

How many members there are in the error part of this set, i.e. not counting any
central member(s).

TODO: Default to NumMembers - 1?

Assumed structure of PDF sets has first error member at Nmem = 1?

Note: there is no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are
consecutively numbered. This number is the official number of error set members
in the released set.


Interpolator
------------
MANDATORY (for grid PDFs)
(enum string): linear, cubic

The factory name string of the PDF grid interpolator to use (if overriding the
default). Could also be member-specific.


Extrapolator
------------
MANDATORY (for grid PDFs)
(enum string): error

The factory name string of the PDF grid extrapolator to use (if overriding the
default). Could also be member-specific.


XMin, XMax
----------
MANDATORY
(float)

Minimum and maximum values of x in the PDF set. Could also be member-specific.


Q2Min, Q2Max
------------
MANDATORY
(float)

Minimum and maximum values of Q2 in the PDF set, in GeV2. Could also be member-specific.


OrderQCD
--------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 2

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of this set (i.e. 0 =
LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


FlavorScheme
------------
(enum string): fixed/variable

The flavour treatment scheme used in PDF/alpha_s evolution.


NumFlavors
----------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 4 or 5

TODO: Rename as

Maximum/fixed number of flavors used in the fit. Used explicitly in alpha_s evolution.


AlphaS_MZ
---------
MANDATORY
(float): e.g. 0.118

The value of alpha_s at Q = MZ.


AlphaS_OrderQCD
---------------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 2

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of alpha_s corresponding
to this PDF set (i.e. 0 = LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


AlphaS_Type
-----------
MANDATORY
(enum string): ode, analytic, ipol

The method to be used to calculate alpha_s for this set (cf. the AlphaS class hierarchy).


AlphaS_Qs, AlphaS_vals
----------------------
MANDATORY if AlphaS_Type = ipol
(2 x list<float>)

A pair of lists for interpolation-based alpha_s(Q) solving (i.e. Alphas_Type =
ipol). The values of Q are in GeV, and the two lists must be the same length. If
only one of these keys is defined, or if their lengths are different, a metadata
exception will be thrown.


Lambda4, Lambda5 (optional, both must be present if at all)
-----------------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY if AlphaS_Type = analytic
(float): e.g. 0.192

The value of Lambda_QCD in 4 and 5 flavour schemes, can be used with
AlphaS_OrderQCD in determining an alpha_s evolution corresponding
to this PDF set.


ErrorType
---------
OPTIONAL (but should be present if there is an error set)
(enum string): replica, symmhessian, asymmhessian, none

A set-level declaration of the type of error treatment provided by this set.

@todo Also specify the Hessian confidence interval... via a separate flag?


CentralMember
-------------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 0

The member ID in this PDF set of the main ("central") member. Usually 0.


PosDefCentralMember
-------------------
OPTIONAL but should be present if there is a positive-definite central member
(uint): e.g. 101

The member ID in this PDF set of a main ("central") member with a positive
definiteness constraint. Important for parton shower programs where negative (or
even zero?) values in PDFs do not make sense in the ISR Sudakov emission
probability interpretation.


FirstErrorMember
----------------
OPTIONAL but should be present if there is an error set
(uint): e.g. 1

The member ID in this PDF set of the first member of an error set. Usually 1.


MZ, MUp, MDown, MStrange, MCharm, MBottom, MTop
-----------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL
(float)

Masses of quarks and the Z0 boson in this PDF set's evolution. Default values
are set in the global LHAPDF config.


MinLHAPDFVersion
----------------
OPTIONAL but should be present if some LHAPDF6 versions are incompatible.
(int): e.g. 600001

Minimal LHAPDF version code (integerised) needed to use this PDF.


# Status
# ------
# OPTIONAL
# (enum str: approved/prelim)

# Set this to 'prelim' if you want to flag this PDF as unsuitable for production use.
# The LHAPDF system will produce a warning printout in that case.


DataVersion
-----------
OPTIONAL
(int)

The version of this PDF's data file. Use a negative value to flag this PDF as
unsuitable for production use. The LHAPDF system will produce a warning printout
in that case.


MEMBER LEVEL
============

Format
------
MANDATORY
(enum string): lhagrid1, ... the trailing number is for format versioning.

Used to determine what parser should be instantiated to read the member file(s).


PdfDesc
-------
OPTIONAL
(free string): Description of the role of this PDF member


PdfType
-------
MANDATORY
(enum string): central # or 'error' or 'replica'

The type of this PDF, i.e. is it a central (canonical) PDF or is it meant for
use as either a Hessian error or a replica member of a statistical ensemble.

@todo Treat "posdef" and other constructions as orthogonal to the "type"?
