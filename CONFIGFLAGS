LHAPDF v6 CONFIGURATION FLAGS
=============================

Documentation of the configuration flags for use in LHAPDF at the global
settings, PDF set info, and PDF member info levels. If a configuration key
is requested from a PDF member info and is not found, the search will fall
back to first the PDF set and then to the global config.


Verbosity
---------
(uint)

Level of verbosity of the LHAPDF system.


ShowLHA5Banner
--------------
(bool)

Whether or not to print out an LHAPDF5-style banner to stdout upon set
initialisation.


Interpolator
------------
(enum string): linear, cubic

The factory name string of the PDF grid interpolator to use (if overriding the
default)


Extrapolator
------------
(enum string): error

The factory name string of the PDF grid extrapolator to use (if overriding the
default).


ImplicitFlavorAction
--------------------
(enum string): return_zero, error

What to do if an xf value for an unsupported PID code is requested? Either
return 0 (i.e. there is implicitly none of that parton in the hadron) or throw
an error.


# SetName
# -------
# (free string): EXAMPLEPDF

# TODO: Allow? Just use dirname instead


SetDesc
-------
(free string): A human-readable description of this PDF set.


Flavors
-------
(list<int> or int): [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,21]

List of supported (user-visible) parton flavors, using the PDG Monte Carlo
numbering scheme (quarks from 1 .. 6, antiquarks from -6 .. -1, and gluon = 21,
as well as any "optional extras" such as photon = 22).


OrderQcd
--------
(uint): 2 # or better to use text cf. lo, nlo, nnlo?

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of this set (i.e. 0 =
LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


AlphaS_MZ
---------
(float): 0.118

The value of alpha_s at Q = MZ.


NumMembers
----------
(uint): 1

How many members there are in the set.

TODO: no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are consecutively
numbered. Instead determine how many members are available by counting member
data files in the PDF set directory.


Format
------
(enum string): lhagrid1, ... the trailing number is for format versioning.

Used to determine what parser should be instantiated to read the member file(s).


ErrorType
---------
(enum string): replica, symmhessian, asymmhessian

@todo Also specify the Hessian confidence interval... via a separate flag?


PdfDesc
-------
(free string): Description of the role of this PDF member


PdfType
-------
(enum string): central # or 'error' or 'replica'

The type of this PDF, i.e. is it a central (canonical) PDF or is it meant for
use as either a Hessian error or a replica member of a statistical ensemble.

@todo Treat "posdef" and other constructions as orthogonal to the "type"?


MainMemberId
-------
(uint):

The member ID in this PDF set of the main ("central") member.


PosDefMainMemberId
-------
(uint):

The member ID in this PDF set of a main ("central") member with a positive
definiteness constraint. Important for parton shower programs where negative (or
even zero?) values in PDFs do not make sense in the ISR Sudakov emission
probability interpretation.
