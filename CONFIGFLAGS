LHAPDF v6 CONFIGURATION FLAGS
=============================

Documentation of the configuration flags for use in LHAPDF at the global
settings, PDF set info, and PDF member info levels. If a configuration key
is requested from a PDF member info and is not found, the search will fall
back to first the PDF set and then to the global config.


Note that there is no such thing as a uniquely config-level or set-level
quantity: all flags may be set at config, set, or member level -- what
determines the functionality is the value as evaluated on a PDF member
regardless of whether it is set directly on that member or if it has cascaded
down from a higher grouping level.


CONFIG LEVEL
============

@note The flags listed here are simply most *likely* to be used at config-level,
but they can be set differently for each set or for each member in a set if so
desired. Flags set at a more specific level always take precedence.


Verbosity
---------
(uint)

Level of verbosity of the LHAPDF system.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!


ShowBanner
----------
(bool)

Whether or not to print out an LHAPDF5-style banner to stdout upon PDF
initialisation.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED


UndefFlavorAction
-----------------
(enum string): return_zero, error

What to do if an xf value for an unsupported PID code is requested? Either
return 0 (i.e. there is implicitly none of that parton in the hadron) or throw
an error.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED: TOO MUCH OVERHEAD? (A METADATA STRING WOULD BE CHECKED FOR EVERY ACCESS TO 6/-6 UNLESS CACHING IS USED)


PwdInSearchPath
---------------
(bool)

Whether to implicitly include the current directory in the PDF set search path.

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!



SET LEVEL
=========

@note The flags listed here are simply most *likely* to be used at set-level,
but they can be set differently for each member in a set (or at the global
config level) if so desired. Flags set at a more specific level always take
precedence.


SetDesc
-------
MANDATORY
(free string): A human-readable description of this PDF set.


Authors
-------
MANDATORY
(free string): Authors of this PDF set.


Year
----
OPTIONAL
(uint): Year in which this PDF fit was made.


Reference
---------
OPTIONAL
(free string): A reference to the paper that describes this PDF set. Use semicolons
to separate a standard journal string, arXiv ID, DOI code, etc.


Flavors
-------
MANDATORY
(list<int> or int): [-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,21]

List of supported (user-visible) parton flavors, using the PDG Monte Carlo
numbering scheme (quarks from 1 .. 6, antiquarks from -6 .. -1, and gluon = 21,
as well as any "optional extras" such as photon = 22).


NumMembers
----------
MANDATORY
(uint): 1

How many members there are in the set, including the central member(s) and error
set members.

Note: there is no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are
consecutively numbered. This number is the official number of members in the
released set.


NumErrorMembers
---------------
OPTIONAL... may _become_ mandatory?
(uint): e.g. 50

How many members there are in the error part of this set, i.e. not counting any
central member(s).

TODO: Default to NumMembers - 1?

Assumed structure of PDF sets has first error member at Nmem = 1?

Note: there is no guarantee that all members are installed or that they are
consecutively numbered. This number is the official number of error set members
in the released set.


Interpolator
------------
MANDATORY (for grid PDFs)
(enum string): linear, cubic

The factory name string of the PDF grid interpolator to use (if overriding the
default). Could also be member-specific.


Extrapolator
------------
MANDATORY (for grid PDFs)
(enum string): error

The factory name string of the PDF grid extrapolator to use (if overriding the
default). Could also be member-specific.


XMin, XMax
----------
MANDATORY
(float)

Minimum and maximum values of x in the PDF set. Could also be member-specific.


QMin, QMax
------------
MANDATORY
(float)

Minimum and maximum values of Q in the PDF set, in GeV. Could also be member-specific.


OrderQCD
--------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 2

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of this set (i.e. 0 =
LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


FlavorScheme
------------
(enum string): fixed/variable

TODO: Also provide optional override AlphaS_FlavorScheme

The flavour treatment scheme used in PDF/alpha_s evolution.


NumFlavors
----------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 4 or 5

TODO: Also provide optional override AlphaS_NumFlavors

Maximum/fixed number of flavors used in the fit. Used explicitly in alpha_s evolution.


AlphaS_MZ
---------
MANDATORY
(float): e.g. 0.118

The value of alpha_s at Q = MZ.


AlphaS_OrderQCD
---------------
MANDATORY
(uint): e.g. 2

Maximum number of loops considered in the QCD evolution of alpha_s corresponding
to this PDF set (i.e. 0 = LO, 1 = NLO, etc.)


AlphaS_Type
-----------
MANDATORY
(enum string): ode, analytic, ipol

The method to be used to calculate alpha_s for this set (cf. the AlphaS class
hierarchy).


AlphaS_Qs, AlphaS_vals
----------------------
MANDATORY if AlphaS_Type = ipol
(2 x list<float>)

A pair of lists for interpolation-based alpha_s(Q) solving (i.e. Alphas_Type =
ipol). The values of Q are in GeV, and the two lists must be the same length. If
only one of these keys is defined, or if their lengths are different, a metadata
exception will be thrown.


AlphaS_Lambda3, AlphaS_Lambda4, AlphaS_Lambda5 (mandatory if using analytic alpha_s)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY if AlphaS_Type = analytic
(float): e.g. 0.192

The value of Lambda_QCD in 3, 4 and 5 flavour schemes, used with
AlphaS_OrderQCD in determining an alpha_s evolution corresponding
to this PDF set if the analytic alpha_s evaluation scheme is used.

A contiguous range of Lambda_n's must be provided, e.g. (3,4,5) or (4,5) or just
(5) are ok, but (3,5) is not.


ErrorType
---------
OPTIONAL (but should be present if there is an error set)
(enum string): replicas, symmhessian, asymmhessian, none

A set-level declaration of the type of error treatment provided by this set.


ErrorCL
-------
OPTIONAL (but should be present if there is a Hessian error set)
(float): e.g. 0.68, 0.90


CentralMember
-------------
MANDATORY
(int): e.g. 0

The member ID in this PDF set of the main ("central") member. Usually 0. A
negative value indicates that this set has no central member.


FirstErrorMember
----------------
OPTIONAL but should be present if there is an error set
(uint): e.g. 1

The member ID in this PDF set of the first member of an error set. Usually 1.


MZ, MUp, MDown, MStrange, MCharm, MBottom, MTop
-----------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL
(float)

Masses of quarks and the Z0 boson in this PDF set's evolution. Default values
are set in the global LHAPDF config.


MinLHAPDFVersion
----------------
OPTIONAL but should be present if some LHAPDF6 versions are incompatible.
(int): e.g. 600001

Minimal LHAPDF version code (integerised) needed to use this PDF.


# Status
# ------
# OPTIONAL
# (enum str: approved/prelim)

# Set this to 'prelim' if you want to flag this PDF as unsuitable for production use.
# The LHAPDF system will produce a warning printout in that case.


DataVersion
-----------
OPTIONAL
(int)

The version of this PDF's data file, used to version fixes to the set.

@note Use a negative value to flag this PDF as unsuitable for production
use. The LHAPDF system will produce a warning printout in that case.


ForcePositive
-------------
OPTIONAL
(uint = 0,1,2, default = 0)

If 0, no positivity forcing will be made. If 1, force returned PDF values to be
positive (always > 0), to avoid accidental interpolation overshoots into
negative values. If 2, force returned PDF values to be positive definite (always
> 1e-10), to avoid both negative values and *also* ensure that the PDF is never
exactly 0, to avoid issues with reweighting.


MEMBER LEVEL
============

@note The flags listed here are simply most *likely* to be used at member-level,
but they can also be set at the set or global config level if so desired. This
tends not to make sense for most of the flags listed here, however. Flags set at
a more specific level always take precedence.

Format
------
MANDATORY
(enum string): lhagrid1, ... the trailing number is for format versioning.

Used to determine what parser should be instantiated to read the member file(s).


PdfDesc
-------
OPTIONAL
(free string): Description of the role of this PDF member


PdfType
-------
MANDATORY
(enum string): central # or 'error' or 'replica'

The type of this PDF, i.e. is it a central (canonical) PDF or is it meant for
use as either a Hessian error or a replica member of a statistical ensemble.

@todo Treat "posdef" and other constructions as orthogonal to the "type"?
